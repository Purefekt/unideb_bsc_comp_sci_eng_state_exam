<h2 id="part-1">Part 1</h2>
<h3 id="combinational-logic">Combinational Logic</h3>
<p>Combinational Logic is a type of digital logic that is implemented by Boolean circuits, where the output is a pure function of the present input only. This contrasts with sequential logic, in which the output depends not only on the present input but also on the history of the input, thus sequential logic has memory while combinational logic does not. Combinational logic is used in computer circuits to perform Boolean algebra on input signals and stored data. Computers contain lots of elements that are made using combinational logic like multiplexers, demultiplexers, encoders, decoders, comparators, arithmetic logic units, etc. These circuits are made up of basic NAND, NOR, or NOT gates that are combined or connected to produce more complicated circuits. We have three main ways of specifying the function of a combinational logic circuit:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boolean Algebra – This is the algebraic expression showing the operation of the logic circuit for each input variable either True or False.</li>
<li>Truth Table – A truth table defines all outputs of a logic gate for given input combinations.</li>
<li>Logic Diagram – This is a graphical representation of the logic circuit that shows the wiring and connections of each logic gate.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="multiplexers">Multiplexers</h3>
<p>Multiplexers or MUX are combinational logic circuits that take in several analogs or digital input signals and output only one. The selection is managed by a separate set of digital inputs known as select lines. It can have a maximum of 2^n data inputs, n selection lines, and a single output line. One of these data inputs is connected to the output line. In a 4x1 multiplexer, we have 4 data inputs, 2 selection lines, and 1 output. We can construct a truth table of the selection line values, we will have 4 such combinations for both values of each selection line, these 4 combinations will each refer to one of the 4 data inputs. MUX is used in communication systems and computer memory.</p>
<h3 id="demultiplexers">Demultiplexers</h3>
<p>Demultiplexers or demux are combinational logic circuits that can distribute multiple outputs from a single input. A demux has one input, n number of output lines, m number of control lines and it should conform to n = 2^m. In a 1 to 4 demux, we have 1 input, 4 outputs, and 2 control bits. As we have 4 different Boolean combinations for the control bits, these will dictate which of the 4 outputs is used. Demux is used in the arithmetic logic unit and serial to parallel converters.</p>
<h3 id="encoders">Encoders</h3>
<p>Encoders are combinational logic circuits that convert binary information in the form of 2^n input lines into n output lines. For example, we have octal to binary encoder. This takes in 8 input lines and generates 3 output lines, where n = 3. We have a special encoder called the priority encoder which compresses the multiple binary input into a small number of outputs. Encoders are used to translate decimal values to binary for operations like addition, subtraction. Priority encoders are used to detect interrupts in microprocessors applications.</p>
<h3 id="decoders">Decoders</h3>
<p>Decoders are combinational logic circuits that do the opposite job of encoders. It converts n lines of input into 2^n lines of output. For example, we have a 3 to 8 decoder where n = 3. Decoders are used in code conversions, in high-performance memory systems, and for data distribution.</p>
<h3 id="digital-comparators">Digital comparators</h3>
<p>Digital comparators are electronic devices that take two numbers as input in binary form and determine whether one number is greater than, less than, or equal to the other number. Comparators are used in microprocessors and microcontrollers. These are made up of AND, NOR, and NOT gates. A 1-bit digital comparator is the simplest digital comparator, it can compare 2 inputs of 1 bit each. We can formulate a truth table that compares these 2 bits.</p>
<h3 id="parity-generators">Parity generators</h3>
<p>Parity generators are used for error detection during data transmission. When data is transmitted, there may be noise that can change a 1 to 0 or a 0 to a 1. The parity bit is added to the data to make the 1s either even or odd. At the receiving end, the number of 1s is counted and if it doesn’t match with the transmitted data, then it means there is an error in the data. A parity generator is a combinational logic circuit that generates the parity bit in the transmitter. On the receiving end, we have a parity checker which checks the parity. A combination of parity generators and parity checkers is used in digital systems to detect single-bit errors in transmitted data. In even parity, the parity bit will make the total number of 1s an even number, and for odd parity, it will do the same, but the sum will be odd. These errors can be detected and corrected using exclusive OR gates. In a combinational circuit that accepts n-1 bit data, it generates a parity bit which is added to the bitstream. In an even parity bit scheme, the parity bit is 0, if there are an even number of 1s and 1 if there are odd number of 1s. For example: if we want to transmit a 3-bit message with an even parity bit, we have 4 bits in total, A, B, C, and P is the parity bit. We can formulate a truth table with 8 different combinations of A, B, C, for half of the P will be 0 and for the other half, it will be 1.</p>
<h3 id="arithmetic-logic-unit-alu">Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</h3>
<p>Arithmetic Logic Unit or ALU is a combinational logic circuit that performs arithmetic and bitwise operations on integer binary numbers. This contrasts with the floating-point unit which operates on floating-point numbers or decimals. The inputs to an ALU are the data to be operated on called the operands and a code indicating the operation to be performed. The output is the result of the performed operation on the operands. Many ALU designs, also have status inputs or outputs which convey information about a previous operation or the current operation between ALU and an external status register. Basic ALU has three parallel data buses consisting of two input operands and result output. The opcode is a parallel bus that conveys the ALU an operation selection code.</p>
<h2 id="part-2">Part 2</h2>
<p>Problem-solving is the method to reach the desired goal or find a solution to a given situation. In computer science, problem-solving refers to artificial intelligence techniques using efficient algorithms, heuristics, etc. to find solutions. Some general problem-solving methods are:</p>
<h3 id="heuristics-searching-algorithms">Heuristics &amp; Searching Algorithms</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Heuristics – This type of method understands the problem and finds a solution based on experimental and trial and error methods. However, these heuristics do not often find the best optimal solution to a specific problem, instead, these offer quick and efficient solutions to attain immediate goals. Since this method is fast and efficient but has lower inaccuracy, it can be combined with optimization algorithms to increase the accuracy of this method. An example of such a problem is the traveling salesman problem where we have a list of cities and their distances, the user must find the optimal route for the salesman to visit every city and return to the starting city. Using a greedy algorithm, we pick the next best step on every current city.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Searching Algorithms – Searching is a very common method of solving a problem. Rational agents use these searching algorithms to find optimal solutions. These agents are goal-based and use atomic representation. These algorithms base the quality of the solution by keeping in mind optimality, time complexity, and space complexity. There are two main types of search algorithms:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Informed Search – These algorithms use basic domain knowledge and understand the available information. They use this as a guideline for optimal solutions. These are more efficient solutions than uninformed searches. Some examples are Greedy search and A* search. A greedy algorithm for example finds the optimal choice at each stage, intending to find the global optimal eventually, if we are at a node with 3 possible paths, this algorithm will choose the node with the lowest cost without caring about the overall system. An example is Dijkstra’s algorithm which is a pathfinding algorithm.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Uninformed Search – These algorithms do not have the basic domain knowledge. It contains information regarding traversing a tree and identifying lead and goal nodes. The search goes through every node till reaching the desired destination. Some examples are Breadth-first search, Depth-first search, Uniform cost search, etc. In depth-first search, we traverse a given node till its deepest node, then we go back and on to the next node, we do not go to the next node until we have traversed all child nodes of the node we are on. In breadth-first search, we traverse all nodes on a given level before moving to a deeper level.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="constraint-satisfaction-problems-csp">Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP)</h3>
<p>Constraint Satisfaction Problems or CSP can be used to solve a variety of problems more efficiently. A CSP consists of three components, which are variables that are denoted with a V, domains of those variables which are denoted with a D, and constraints that are denoted with a C. In general, problems we try to represent them as states, we move ahead to different states and try to solve those problems, in a CSP we use these 3 components, V, D, and C. V is the set of variables, this is a finite set, for example, we might have variables like V1, V2, all the way till Vn. D is the set of domains; these are also finite and there is one domain for each variable. An example of a set of domains can be D1, D2, all the way till Dn. The domain of a variable is all set of values that the variable can take, this can be a real number, imaginary number, a color, or anything. C is the set of constraints that specify the allowable combination of values. C is represented as Ci which is a tuple of two elements, scope, and relation. Ci = (scope, relation). The scope is the variables we are currently dealing with, and the relationship defines the relationship between the variables in the scope.
For this example, let us assume the scope is binary, which means the scope contains two variables, let’s say V1 and V2. Now the relationship can be any relationship between these two variables in the scope, let’s say V1 cannot be equal to V2. This relationship is our constraints applied to these two values, so in this example, V1 and V2 can take values from their domain where they do not equal each other, if the domain is a set of all integers from and including 1 to 3, then one valid case could be that V1=1 and V2=2, and an invalid case could be that V1=1 and V2=1. In a constraints satisfaction problem, we have multiple such relationships between many combinations of variables. A CSP is considered solved when all variables have a value assigned to them from the domain with no conflicts of constraints. An example of a CSP is sudoku. In sudoku we have a grid of 9x9, thus we have 81 different variables, we have some pre-filled values, for example, if we have sudoku with 11 filled values, then the set of variables contains 70 elements for each infilled box, the set of domain will be all values each box can take, which is a set consisting of the numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9. Finally, the constraint is that no element can be rotated in its row and column. Using a CSP algorithm like the Arc Consistency algorithm #3 or AC3, we can solve this problem. Another example of a CSP is the fa Australia map coloring problem, where we have to color the 7 regions of Australia, thus the variables are the set of all 7 regions, we can only choose from 3 colors, red, green, and blue, thus the set of the domain contains these 3 colors. Finally, the constraint is that no two neighboring regions can have the same color.</p>
