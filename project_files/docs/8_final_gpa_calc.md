# FINAL GPA CALCULATION

The final GPA calculation is described in the document `Grade calculation of the Final Exam and Diploma > Computer Science Engineering BSc (Before 2017); (After 2017)' available [HERE](https://www.inf.unideb.hu/en/node/1820). The problem is, it is confusing and i didnt understand how it exactly works till i used my final GPA and calculated it on my own.

This is how it is calculated:

```
(A + B + C)/3 (till 2 decimal places)
```

-   A = Average of the grade of thesis posted by your thesis supervisor and the thesis defence grade given during the state exam.
    -   Your supervising professor will post a grade on neptun, it will be either 1,2,3,4 or 5. And 1 is a fail.
    -   The thesis defence will be the 10 minute presentation in front of the board. This will also be either 1,2,3,4 or 5. And 1 is a fail.
    -   For example if your thesis supervisor gave you 5 and the thesis defence was 4, then A == 4.5.
-   B = The grade of the state exam.
    -   This is the 20 minute speech. This is either 1,2,3,4 or 5. And 1 is a fail.
-   C = The final CGPA of all courses taken in all the semesters except the thesis. Till 2 decimal places.
    -   But there is a CATCH, this only includes the courses specified in the CSE course list which can be found in [THIS PDF](https://www.edu.unideb.hu/tartalom/downloads/Computer%20Science%20Engineering%20BSc%20bulletin-2017.pdf?_ga=2.240932483.1476949899.1640888386-852605631.1623741095).
    -   As a CSE student, we have 210 total credits, of which 15 are thesis, which means this is the CGPA of the remaining 195 credits. But we also have to take 10 free choice courses. If you take an elective (Differentiated knowledge topics) course as a free choice, then it will count toward C, but if you took a free choice course like Marketing, which is not in this PDF^, then it wont count towards C and will not affect your final GPA at all.
    -   For example for me, i took total of 216 credits, of which we remove 15 for thesis and get 201 credits. But i also took Ayurveda (2 credits), Sustainability and current environmental issues (3 credits), Foundations of Innovation and Entrepre-neurship (MÃœZLI) (2 credits) and Business Etiquette (3 credits) or total 10 free choice credits which were NOT on that list. That is why even though i got 5 in all these courses, it did not affect my final GPA. Thus the C value for me was calculated using 191 credits.
    -   This means taking 2 elective (Differentiated knowledge topics) courses to make up for the 10 free choice credits courses and getting 5 in it will allow you to boost this value.
