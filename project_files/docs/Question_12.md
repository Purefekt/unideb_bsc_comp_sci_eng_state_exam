## Part 1

The entity-relationship model or ER model describes interrelated things of interest in a specific domain. A basic ER model is composed of entity types that classify the things of interest and specify relationships that can exist between entities or instances of those entity types. ER models are commonly formed to represent things a business needs to remember to perform business processes. The ER model becomes an abstract data model, that defines a data or information structure that can be implemented in a database, typically a relational database. An entity-relationship model is also called an entity-relationship diagram or ERD. ERD is a type of structural diagram for use in database design, it uses different symbols and connectors to visualize two important information, the major entities in the system and the inter-relationships among these entities. When we are talking about entities in an ERD, we are often referring to business objects such as people and roles, tangible business objects like products, and intangible business objects like logs. The relationship is how these entities relate to each other within the system.

Entity-relationship diagrams are composed of entities, relationships, and attributes. They also depict cardinality which defines the relationship in terms of numbers:
Entity – This is a definable thing like a person or object or event that can have data stored about it. These are typically shown as a rectangle. Entities can be a strong entity that is defined solely by their attributes and weak entity which cannot be defined solely by their own attributes. A weak entity is related to its corresponding strong entity which defines it, this kind of relationship is known as an identifying relation. A strong entity is a rectangle whereas a weak entity is a double-lined rectangle.
Attribute – These are properties or characteristics of an entity. These are drawn as ovals. A super key is a set of attributes, one or more that together define an entity. The candidate key is the minimal super key which has the least number of attributes that can still be a super key. A primary key is a candidate key chosen by the database designer; this will be used to uniquely identify the entity set. A foreign key identifies the relationships between entities. A primary key will have an underline. Attributes can be simple atomic attributes, compositive attributes which can be broken down into separate attributes like a full name attribute can be broken down into a first name and last name attribute, and a derived attribute is derived from another attribute such as age can be derived from a date of birth attribute. A derived attribute is shown as an oval with a dotted outline. A multi-valued attribute can have multiple values, like a phone number attribute, this is shown as an oval with a double outline.
Cardinality – This is a numerical representation of the relationship between two entities. There are three main cardinalities, one-to-one is when one attribute is related to one attribute, an example would be one student being associated with one mailing address. A one-to-many relationship means one attribute is related to many attributes, an example would be one student registers for multiple courses, but all courses have a single student registered to it. A many-to-many relationship is when multiple attributes on both entities can be related to one another, an example could be multiple students can be associated with multiple faculty members, and in turn, multiple faculty members are related to multiple students. A relationship is shown as a diamond between two entities which describes the relationship as a verb, on both sides of the diamond it connects the entities with a line, on top of this line If there is a 1 then it means it’s one relationship from that side, or it can be N which means many relationships. Thus we can have different variations like 1:1, 1:N, N:1, and M:N where M:N is many to many and we use M here to differentiate it from N. An identifying relation is represented as a double-lined diamond.

A relational schema is a blueprint used in database design to represent the data to be entered into the database and describes how that data is structured into tables which are called relations in relational schemas. The schema describes how those tables relate to each other. In a relational schema, the table or relation consists of a set of columns called attributes and a set of rows called tuples. Each row is unique, but the rows can be moved around, changed in order, modified, or deleted.

A database designer usually starts by designing the visual ERD, once this is done, we can convert this conceptual model into a logical model which breaks down entities, attributes, and relationships into tables, columns, fields, and keys. To convert an ERD to a relational schema, we will use these steps:
Convert the strong entity types into a table. Identify the primary key attribute and mention it. The attributes will be the columns.
Convert the weak entity types into their table, but here the primary key will be the primary key of the strong entity type as a foreign key. The attributes will be the columns.
We can now convert the relationships. There are three degrees of relationships; Binary relationships are those where two different entity types are participating. Like a student enrolled in a course. A unary relationship describes when the same entity type is the only participant. For example, a record of citizens where citizens in the same entity are married to each other, is a unary relationship. A ternary relationship is one where three different entity types are participating, for example, an online store might have tables representing customer, product, and supplier. With the degrees and cardinality, we can create the relations in an order using primary keys and foreign keys.
● Binary 1:1 – Primary key of either one entity can be used as a foreign key for the other entity.
● Binary 1:N – Primary key of the 1 side will be the foreign key for the N side.
● Binary M:N – Here a new relation is created, in which the primary key is a composite key of two foreign keys.
● Unary 1:1 – Primary key of one can be the foreign key of the other in any way.
● Unary 1:N – We can use a recursive foreign key. The foreign key will reference a primary key in the same relation.
● Ternary – Here we need a third table. The primary key of the new table takes foreign keys from each of the participants.

## Part 2

A diode is a semiconductor device that essentially acts as a one-way switch for current. It allows current to flow easily in one direction but severely restricts current from flowing in the opposite direction. Diodes are also known as rectifiers because they change alternating current AC into pulsating direct current DC. Diodes are rated according to their type, voltage, and current capacity. The polarity of diodes is determined by the anode, which is the positive lead, and the cathode, which is the negative lead. A diode symbol uses a triangle with a pipe at one end. The base of the triangle end is the anode and the pipe end is the cathode, current flows from anode to cathode. When a diode allows current, it is forward-biased. When a diode is reverse-biased, it acts as an insulator and does not permit current to flow.

Rectifiers are a type of diode; rectification is an application of diodes. Rectification is the conversion of alternating current AC to direct current DC. This involves a device that only allows the one-way flow of electric charge which is the diode. The simplest kind of rectifier circuit is the half-wave rectifier. It only allows one-half of an AC waveform to pass through the load.
Half-wave rectification is insufficient for more applications. The AC power source is only able to supply power to the load one-half every cycle, meaning half of its capacity is unused which makes it inefficient. Half-wave rectification is the simplest way to reduce power to a resistive load, this can be used in for example a two-position lamp dimmer switches that apply full AC power to the lamp filament for full brightness level and then half-wave rectify for less or dimmer brightness. The other kind of rectification is full-wave rectification, this is used when we need the full power of the input AC where we use both the positive and negative half-cycles of the AC wave. We can perform full-wave rectification with a full-wave center-tapped rectifier and a bridge full-wave rectifier. A center-tapped rectifier, in this rectifier we have an input circuit where the AC input is connected with a transformer in the middle connected to another circuit which is the output circuit, where we want to receive the full-wave DC output. Here the transformer side in the output circuit has a wire in the center of the transformer, thus the name, center-tapped. We connect two diodes, one to each end of the sides of the center-tapped wire. When the polarity is positive, one of the diodes is forward biased, and the other is reversed biased and the forward-biased diode and the current flows towards the load, when the polarity switches to negative, now the diode which was the previous forward-biased becomes reverse biased and the diode which was reversed biased becomes forward biased. This causes the current to flow through the second diode and to the load. This way we can use the full potential of the incoming AC, but this time our entire output is DC. The bridge rectifier has an input circuit where the AC input lines and a transformer are connected to an output circuit, this transformer does not have a center-tapped wire, this circuit is connected to 4 diodes that have one output that goes to the load. The diodes are arranged in a diamond pattern and opposite side diodes work together. Let's say we have 4 diodes, D1, D2, D3, and D4. D1 and D3 are opposite diodes and D2 and D4 are opposite diodes. When the input AC has positive polarity, the diodes D1 and D3 will be forward biased and the other two will be reverse biased, the current travels to the load through D1 and D3 when the polarity flips, now D2 and D4 will be forward biased and the other diodes will be reverse biased and the current flows to the load through D2 and D4. This way we convert all of the input AC to DC. The output of a full-wave rectifier is twice that of a half-wave rectifier.

A DC-DC converter converts one DC voltage to another. The operating voltage of different electronic devices such as ICs can vary over a wide range, this makes it necessary to provide a different voltage for each element. DC-DC converters are based on an electronic circuit that uses electronic switching technology. A DC-DC converter can support both very low voltage and high voltage applications. DC-DC converters are used when the voltage must be regulated and consistent, to avoid any fluctuations. These converters use high-frequency switching circuits, together with conductors and capacitors to reduce the noise and maintain a DC voltage. Before DC-DC converters were used, electronics used rectifiers and transformers, this was inefficient and wasted a lot of energy as heat. Since DC-DC converters are extremely efficient, they are ideal for use in small devices like mobile phones and laptops. Buck converter is a type of DC-DC converter that produces a voltage that has been stepped down from the input voltage. This can be used to power lower voltage devices from a higher voltage source. A boost converter on the other hand steps up the voltage and produces a higher output voltage as opposed to the lower input voltage. A buck-boost converter is a dual-purpose DC-DC converter that can step up or step down the voltage to produce an output that may be higher or lower than the input.

A voltage regulator is a system designed to automatically maintain a constant voltage. A voltage regulator may use a simple feed-forward design or may include negative feedback These can be used to regulate AC and DC voltages. Electronic voltage regulators are found in devices such as computer power supply units or PSUs where they stabilize the DC voltages used by the processor and the other elements.
Just like the need to regulate the voltage, there are scenarios where we need to regulate the current which is being supplied to a particular part of a circuit. Unlike voltage regulation where we step up or step down the voltage to meet different needs, current regulation focuses on supplying a constant current, irrespective of variations in load resistance or input voltage. Current regulators involve variations in voltage or resistance to achieve the stable current output, this is based on the ohms law. An example could be if we have a variable resistor in a circuit, this variable resistor will change its resistance based on feedback from the circuit to maintain the given current value.
