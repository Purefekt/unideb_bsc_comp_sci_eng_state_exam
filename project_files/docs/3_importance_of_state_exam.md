# IMPORTANCE OF THE STATE EXAM

-   This 20-minute speech will count for 33% of your final degree GPA. The other 33% comes from the average of the grade your thesis supervisor gave you and the thesis defense grade (thesis defense happens right before the state exam). And the last 33% comes from the CGPA of all your courses taken in all the 3.5 years (7 semesters), except the thesis.
-   So basically, doing well in these 20 minutes carries the same weightage as working hard for all the semesters, that is why you can boost your final GPA by acing the thesis and state exam.
