# MY STATE EXAM EXPERIENCE

-   My time slot was 8:00 am and my assigned number was 1, which meant I was the first on that day.
-   There were 8 other Hungarian students of BSc. Computer Science Engineering and everyone was dressed in complete formals.
-   When I entered the room, there were 5 board members and one assistant sitting on the left. The president of the board was mediating the whole thing. He told me to copy my thesis ppt to the projector laptop and start. I had my thesis ppt on a USB drive, so I copied it, they gave me a pointer with which I could move the slides.
-   I started speaking, but keep in mind to go fast, since I was taking too long because I had a lot of material, the president of the board nudged me to speed up. Once I was done presenting, the president of the board asked the others if they had any questions, everyone said no. Then he asked me a simple question about the dataset I used in my thesis.
-   Once the thesis presentation was done, the president of the board ran a random number generator and I got the number 10. He gave me a copy of the topics of the state exam containing all 15 questions, empty pieces of paper and told me I had 30 minutes to prepare topic number 10.
-   Luckily topic 10 was one of my best-prepared topics so I asked them if I can start right away. I sat down in the chair and started speaking the first subtopic. I spoke fast, almost rapping, and in great detail. Halfway into answering the first subtopic, the president of the board told me to stop and asked if anyone had any questions, everyone said no.
-   Then I started talking about the 2nd subtopic, again speaking fast and in great detail. Again the president told me to stop, he asked if anyone had any questions, everyone said no. This time he asked me a tricky question about the 2nd subtopic, and I answered it best to my knowledge.
-   Once I was done, I left the room and they told me that I will get the results around 1:00 pm.
-   At this point, the next person goes in, and slowly everyone on that day gets their thesis defense and state exam done. On my day there were 9 of us, and around 12:30 pm, everyone was done.
-   Then they told us to wait another 30 minutes.
-   Then they called all of us inside, all the board members were now standing and the 9 of us were standing on the opposite side.
-   The president of the board asked for our consent to say the grades out loud and he started telling the grades of the thesis defense and the state exam in the original order.
-   Since I was the first, he said 5 in thesis defense and 5 in state exam and then moved on to the others.
-   Once everyone's grades were told, everyone shook hands and left. A few hours after that, I got a message on Neptun that my student status has been changed to 'Graduated' and on Neptun -> `CHANGE` I saw the final grade there.
-   10 days after this, I got my original Degree Certificate and Diploma Supplement. The degree certificate is a single-page document saying you graduated from this university in this course. The diploma supplement includes more detailed information including the transcript of all courses taken.
