-   The state exam is a 20-minute speech that the student must give in front of 5-6 board members.
-   The topic is randomly chosen using a random number generator and comes from a pool of 15 pre-defined topics posted [HERE](https://www.inf.unideb.hu/en/node/1826), under the heading 'Final exam topics'. You must log in using your Neptun ID to access this page. This link might change in the future, in which case please let me know by contributing on GitHub or sending me an email.
-   These are the solutions to 'who started after 2017/2018/1'.
-   The question will be selected using a random number generator and you will not be allowed to use any notes or a computer. You can create notes from memory in the 30 minute preparation time given to you.
-   Each question has 2 subtopics, and you have to speak on both subtopics, roughly for 10 minutes each.
-   These are my answers which I curated using multiple resources. My approach was to write around 2100 words per question or 1050 words per subtopic.
-   These answers are written in a speech-like flow, with no diagrams, visuals, or formulas.
-   IMPORTANT: Memorizing all 30k+ words in this document is stupid and will cause you to feel suicidal. These topics are core computer science engineering concepts, which means there's logic to everything. For each topic, watch simple explainer youtube videos with visuals so you can store that image in your head, and then while speaking, you can re-run it in your mind and that will make speaking easy. Use these answers as a guideline.
