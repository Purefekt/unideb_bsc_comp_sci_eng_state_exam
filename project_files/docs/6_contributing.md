# CONTRIBUTE

There might be grammatical errors, typos, or missing information (mostly in the electronics, control system and signals and systems based topics), that is why if you spot any such mistake, please make sure to correct it by contributing in these two ways:

-   Contributing directly on GitHub:

    -   You can contribute to this project [HERE](https://github.com/Purefekt/unideb_bsc_comp_sci_eng_state_exam)
    -   The information is written in simple markdown files found on the main branch in the project_files/docs directory. You can open the markdown file you wish to edit and make the changes.
    -   Contributing to a GitHub project is straightforward, if you need help you can refer to [THIS ARTICLE](https://www.dataschool.io/how-to-contribute-on-github/)
    -   If you contribute this way, then your GitHub username will appear as a contributor which is great for your profile.

-   Sending me an email:
    -   This method is not preferred but you can send me an email -> veersingh230799@gmail.com and let me know where the mistake is.

PS: The typos or errors in the question itself are fine. It is exactly how it was printed on the pdf so it is not changed. If a student tries to copy-paste the entire question, then this website should show up, but if I corrected the typos in the questions, then this would not work.
