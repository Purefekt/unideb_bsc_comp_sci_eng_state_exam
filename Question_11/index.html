<h2 id="part-1">Part 1</h2>
<h3 id="interprocess-communication">Interprocess communication</h3>
<p>Interprocess communication or IPC is the mechanism an operating system provides to allow the processes to manage shared data. These processes are instances of a computer program that is being executed by one or many threads. There are two kinds of processes, independent processes which are not affected by the execution of other processes thus do not use IPC, and cooperating processes that can be and may affect other executing processes, here we use IPC to increase modularity. Typically, applications can use IPC as clients and servers, where the client requests data and the server responds to client requests. Many applications are both clients and servers. This communication could involve a process letting another process know that some event has occurred, or data can be transferred from one process to another.</p>
<h3 id="file">File</h3>
<p>A file is a record stored on a disk or a record created on demand by a file server, this can be accessed by multiple processes. All operating systems use files for data storage. Shared files are the most basic IPC mechanism. A simple example could be when one process creates and writes to a file and another process reads this same file. A special race condition might arise when the production process and the reader process try to access the file at the same time, here we can lock the file through the produces process, no other process can access the file till the lock phase.</p>
<h3 id="signal">Signal</h3>
<p>A signal is a system message which is sent from one process to another, not usually used to transfer data but instead used to remotely command the partnered process. This is available in most operating systems. These messages trigger a specific behavior such as quitting or error handling. A signal is an asynchronous notification sent to a process to notify it of an event. When a signal is sent, the operating system interrupts the target process’ normal flow of execution to deliver the signal, the target process might have a registered signal handler that executes its defined routine, otherwise, the default signal handler is executed. Some examples of system signals are SIGSTOP and SIGKILL.</p>
<h3 id="pipe">Pipe</h3>
<p>A pipe is a communication channel that maybe be used for one-way IPC. An implementation of pipe is often integrated with the operating system’s file IO subsystem. Pipe is a mechanism by which the output of one process is directed into the input of another process, a parent process can create several new processes and arrange them in a pipeline. A pipe could be accessed as a file, but the operating system treats it as a first in first out queue. A pipe file is created using the pipe system call, which has an input end and an output end. One can write into a pipe from the input end and read it from the output end. If two processes need to communicate, then the process which writes needs to close its read end of the pipe and the process which reads needs to close its write end of the pipe. Full-duplex or two-way communication requires two pipes.</p>
<h3 id="sockets">Sockets</h3>
<p>Sockets provide point-to-point and two-way communication between two processes. IPC sockets enable channel-based communication for processes on the same physical device, whereas network sockets enable this kind of IPC for processes running on different devices by using networking. Network sockets need support from protocols like TCP to work, they listen on a given TCP/IP socket. IPC sockets communicate using a local file as a socket address. Sockets are bidirectional and use a server-client model, where the client requests information from the server, and the data is transferred using these sockets.</p>
<h2 id="part-2">Part 2</h2>
<h3 id="time-complexity">Time complexity</h3>
<p>Time complexity is the amount of time taken by an algorithm to run, as a function of the length of the input. It measures the time taken to execute each statement of code in an algorithm. Time complexity can define the effectiveness of an algorithm, there may be more than one way to solve a problem in programming, knowing how the algorithm works efficiently can help programmers write better programs.</p>
<h3 id="insertion-sort">Insertion sort</h3>
<p>Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works like when we sort playing cards. In computers, we can sort an array of numbers in an ascending order using insertion sort. Suppose we have an array of integers, and we want to sort it in ascending order, we start by splitting the array into a sorted and an unsorted part. The sorted array at first contains a single element which can be the first element in the original array, this is considered sorted since an array with a single element is sorted. Next, we look at the unsorted part, we take the first element of this part and compare it with the only element in our sorted part, if this new element is larger than our original element, then we place it at the end of the sorted part, otherwise, we place it at the beginning. Next, we will again look at the first element of the unsorted array and compare it to the last element of the sorted part, if it is larger then we place it at the end of the sorted part, otherwise, we compare it to the second last element of the sorted part, if it is larger than it goes to the right of this element otherwise it goes to its left. We repeat this process by taking the first element of the unsorted part, comparing it to all elements in the sorted part starting from the last element to the first, and placing the new element. This way we can sort an array. If n is the number of elements to be sorted, then the time complexity of insertion sort is O(n^2) for the average and worst-case and O(n) for the best case.</p>
<h3 id="merge-sort">Merge sort</h3>
<p>Merge sort is a sorting algorithm that works on the principle of divide and conquers. Merge sort takes an array and divides it into two halves, it then further divides those subarrays into halves until we are let with single element subarrays. Then we compare the adjacent arrays, which contain a single element, so we are comparing two adjacent elements. Here we sort them in an ascending or descending order, based on the objective. Once we have sorted adjacent pairs of elements, now we have multiple subarrays of length two which are relatively sorted. Then we can keep merging the adjacent pairs of subarrays by appointing a pointer to the left-most subarray element and comparing it to the first element of the other subarray, this way we can merge all the subarrays and finally we get a sorted array. Merge sort has the same time complexity of O(n log(n)) for best, worst, and average cases.</p>
<h3 id="linear-and-logarithmic-algorithms">Linear and logarithmic algorithms</h3>
<p>Linear algorithms have the big O notation of O(n), while logarithmic algorithms have the big O notation of O(log n). Linear or O(n) is a brute force technique, the performance is dependent on the input size, thus as the data size scales up, the performance becomes less efficient, but for small data sizes, it can be very fast. An example could be to search for a number in an array, using a linear search algorithm, we can read each item in the array and search for the number, when we hit the number we will stop, thus in the worst case our number would be the last element of the array, in this case, if we have N elements in the array, then we must go through N number of elements.
Logarithmic or O(log n) narrows down the search by repeatedly halving the dataset until we find the target value. An example of this would be binary search, a form of a logarithmic algorithm. The algorithm will traverse either upwards or downwards depending on the target value being higher, lower than, or equal to the median. The most of work this algorithm does is at the beginning, but it slowly flattens out as we discard the irrelevant range from the array and continue halving until we find the target value. We do assume that this array is sorted. As the data increases or in this example as the number of elements in the array increases, the logarithmic algorithm still performs good, whereas the linear algorithm will take way more time since it scales linearly with the data size.</p>
<h3 id="quicksort">Quicksort</h3>
<p>Quicksort is a recursive algorithm like merge sort and is used for sorting. In quick sort we use pivots. Suppose we have an array of integers, and we need to sort it in ascending order. We will first pick a random element to be the pivot, this is usually the first or the last element of the array. We place it at the root and place all elements less than it on the left side and all the elements larger than it on the right. Now we will have 2 subarrays, the one on the left and the one on the right, and the pivot element in the middle. We will apply a quick sort to both subarrays by choosing a random pivot and placing the elements to the left or right. We repeat this process for each subarray till we have single elements left at the end. Now we can simply build the sorted array by keeping the elements on the left of the pivot on the left and the ones on the right of the pivot to the right and go up. We usually use the first or last element of the array as the pivot but in some cases where we might have some information about the range of numbers present, for example, if the range of numbers in our unsorted array is between 0 and 999, then it is wiser to choose a pivot around the median or a number close to 500 since this will make the algorithm run faster. The best and average-case time complexity is O(n log(n)) and the worst-case time complexity is O(n^2). The minimal number of comparisons needed is O(n log(n)) comparisons.</p>
<h3 id="radix-sort">Radix sort</h3>
<p>Radix sort is a sorting algorithm where we do not compare the numbers in the array, this is in contrast to comparison-based algorithms like insertion sort and quicksort. The first step is finding the largest number in the array and identifying the number of digits it contains. Suppose we have an unsorted array of integers, and our largest number is 812, then the larger number of digits an element can have in this array is 3. Now we will convert all numbers in the array to 3 digits, for example, if we have the number 20, then it becomes 020, and the number 5 becomes 005. When dealing with numbers we will start from the least significant digit and move towards the most significant digit. Here we have decimal numbers, thus we can have 10 different numbers at a given digit place, 0-9. We will first group all the ones place digits in all numbers or the least significant number in all numbers into one of 10 buckets. We now write all the elements in an array starting from the 0th bucket and moving to the 9th bucket. This was past 1. In pass 2, we will look at the tens digit position, and again group all the elements into 10 buckets, once we do that, we will form another array of these elements based on the order starting from the 0th bucket to the 9th bucket. In pass 3, we will look at the hundreds digit or the most significant digit, and group the elements in these 10 buckets. Once this is done, we can form another array placing the elements in order from the 0th bucket to the 9th bucket. We will notice that after passing 3, the array is sorted. Thus, the number of passes required is equal to the length of the largest element in the array, and the number of buckets formed on each pass is equal to the number of different values each digit can take, 10 in this case. We can also apply radix sort to strings, for example, we have to sort an array with names using English language, here we will have 26 different buckets since each letter in an element can take one of 26 values from a-z, the number of passes required will be equal to the length of the longest name in the array. When sorting strings we will go from the most significant letter to the least significant letter. The time complexity for this sorting algorithm is O(d*(n+b)). Here d is the length of the largest element or the number passes, n is the number of elements in the array and b is the number of values an individual number of the letter can take on, in the case of integers it is 10.</p>
<h3 id="bucket-sort">Bucket sort</h3>
<p>Bucket sort is the sister sorting algorithm of radix sort, it too does not use comparison to sort the elements. In the initial pass, we will put the elements in separate buckets, but in the case of integers, we will use the most significant number. In the case of integers, we will have 10 buckets and some elements in them. Here we will use another stable sorting algorithm to sort the elements in each bucket. Once each bucket is sorted, we can place them back in an array starting from the 0th group to the 9th group in the case of sorting integers in ascending order. The average time complexity of bucket sort is O(n+k), where n is the number of elements and k is the number of buckets and the worst time complexity is O(n^2). Radix sort is good for spread out or sparse data, whereas bucket sort is good for dense data.</p>
