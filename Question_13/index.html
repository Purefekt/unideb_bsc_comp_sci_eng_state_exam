<h2 id="part-1">Part 1</h2>
<h3 id="pipeline">Pipeline</h3>
<p>A CPU has a fetch, decode, execute cycle or a fetch, decode, execute, store cycle where store is a part of execute. In the fetch phase, the instruction at the program counter is read into the instruction register and the program counter is incremented by one. This instruction has been fetched and is sent to the decode phase where it is decoded. That instruction then flows to the arithmetic logic unit ALU to be executed and the value is finally stored in the memory. This cycle keeps on going on, but here we can create a pipeline where as soon as the first instruction has moved from the fetch phase to the decode phase, we can fetch the next instruction. Next, the first instruction will move to the execute phase, the second instruction can now move to the decode phase and thus we can fetch the third instruction. When all phases are full, this is called a full pipeline and we are utilizing all the CPU. Here we are executing one instruction on each cycle, whereas it would take 4 cycles to complete one instruction in our basic CPU. This is an implementation of instruction-level parallelism within a single processor. The instructions follow a sequential pipe based on the instructions fetched by the program counter. This can be analogous to a modern-day car assembly line, where an unfinished car goes through an assembly line and stops at different stations where robotic arms add different elements to the car, at all times all robotic stations are busy working on an unfinished car, this way we can produce lots of cars in less amount of time.</p>
<h3 id="harzards">Harzards</h3>
<p>Hazard or pipeline hazards are problems that arise in the pipeline which prevent the next instruction from executing during its designated clock cycle, this can potentially lead to incorrect computation results. There are three types of pipeline hazards:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data hazards – This is a condition in which either the source or the destination operands of an instruction are not available at the time expected in the pipeline. As a result of this some operation has to be delayed and the pipeline stalls. This can happen when there are two instructions and one of them depends on the data obtained from the other. For the two given instructions, we have A = 3 + 2 and B = A * 4, here we cannot execute the second instruction till we complete the first instruction since the second instruction needs the output of the first. In a pipelines processor, these two instructions can likely lead to incorrect results due to the data dependency between these two instructions.</li>
<li>Structural hazards – This condition arises when two instructions require a given hardware resource at the same time and hence for one of the instructions the pipeline needs to be stalled. The most common case is when memory is accessed at the same time by two instructions. One instruction may need to access the memory as part of the execute or write back phase while the other instruction is being fetched. In this case, if both the instructions reside in the same memory, both instructions can’t proceed together and one of them needs to be stalled. This can be solved by using sufficient hardware resources like more memory.</li>
<li>Control hazard – The instruction fetch unit of the CPU is responsible for providing a stream of instruction to the execution unit, the instructions fetched by the fetch unit are in consecutive memory locations until they are executed. However, the problem arises when one of the instructions is a branching instruction to some other memory location, this makes all the other fetched instructions in the pipeline from the consecutive memory to be invalid and need to be removed, this is called flushing of the pipeline. This causes a stall till new instructions are again fetched from the memory address specified by the branch instruction.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="out-of-order-execution">Out-of-order execution</h3>
<p>A processor that executes instructions one after the other, may use resources inefficiently which leads to poor performance. To improve the performance of the processor this can be done by executing different sub-steps of sequential instructions simultaneously. Out-of-order execution is an approach that is used in high-performance microprocessors. This approach efficiently uses instruction cycles and reduces costly delays. A processor will execute the instructions in an order of availability of data or operands instead of the original order of the instructions in the program. By doing so, the processor will avoid being idle while data is retrieved for the next instruction in the program. In other words, a processor that uses multiple execution units completes the processing of instructions in the wrong order. Suppose there are two instructions I1 and I2, in that order, in an out-of-order system the processor can execute I2 before I1 has completed.</p>
<h3 id="speculative-execution">Speculative execution</h3>
<p>Speculative execution is an optimization technique where a computer system performs some tasks that may not be needed. Work is done before it is known whether it is needed, to prevent a delay that would have to be incurred by doing the work after it is known that it is needed. If it turns out the work was not needed, after all, most changes made by the work are reverted and the results are ignored. The objective of this is to use the extra resources if they are available or idle. This approach is used by things like branch prediction and pipelined processors.</p>
<h3 id="superscalar-processor">Superscalar processor</h3>
<p>A superscalar processor is a CPU that implements a form of parallelism called instruction-level parallelism within a single processor. In contrast to a scalar processor that can execute at most one single instruction per clock cycle, a superscalar processor can execute more than one instruction during a clock cycle simultaneously by sending multiple instructions to different execution units on the processor. This allows for more throughput or the number of instructions that can be executed in a unit of time than would be otherwise possible at a fixed clock rate. Each execution unit is not a separate processor or a separate core, but it is an execution resource within a single CPU. Superscalar CPU can also be pipelined, here superscalar and pipelining are considered different performance enhancement techniques. Superscalar executes multiple instructions in parallel by using multiple execution units, whereas pipelining executes multiple instructions in the same execution unit in parallel by dividing the execution unit into different phases.</p>
<h3 id="vliw">VLIW</h3>
<p>VLIW or very long instruction word processors are processors in which a language compiler or pre-processor breaks program instructions down into basic operations that can be performed by the processor in parallel, this takes advantage of instruction-level parallelism. These operations are put into a very long instruction word which the processor can then take apart for further analysis, handling each operation to an appropriate functional unit. VLIW is seen as the next step past RISC processors which also work with a limited set of basic instructions and can usually execute more than one instruction at a time, being superscalar. The advantage of VLIW processors is that the complexity is moved from the hardware to software, which means that the hardware can be smaller, cheaper, and require less power to operate. The challenge is in designing a great compiler that is intelligent enough to build very long instruction words. The compiler here bundles the instructions which do not conflict with each other and make all the low-level decisions that make it very complex, the compiler also searches for all instructions which can be executed in parallel. Other than the compiler complexity, the program sizes for VLIW programs are much larger.</p>
<h3 id="vector-processors">Vector processors</h3>
<p>Vector processors are processors which can execute the complete vector input in a single instruction. A vector input is dimensional a set of scalars, which are of the same type arranged in an ordered format. Thus, in other words, a vector processor is a complete unit that executes a sequential set of similar data items in the memory using a single instruction. Vector processors can greatly improve the performance on certain workloads like numerical simulation, deep learning models, and video game rendering.</p>
<h2 id="part-2">Part 2</h2>
<h3 id="optimization-and-evaluation-of-relational-queries">Optimization and evaluation of relational queries</h3>
<p>Query is a request for information from a database, a SQL query needs to be processed first before it can be executed, and the required data can be received or modified. Query processing can be thought of as a block box that takes the SQL query as input and gives the result as output, this result can be returned tuples. Query processing involves three steps, parsing and translation, optimization, and finally evaluation. The first step is parsing and translation, the SQL queries cannot be understood by the system, it is a high-level implementation of the request, which is understood by humans. Thus, in this step, the aim is to convert the high-level statement into low-level relational algebra, which better represents the internal or low-level features of a query. The parser checks the syntax of the query and verifies the names of the relation, tuple, and attribute values. Then it translates it into relational algebra. For example, we need to find the salary of all employees which is more than $100k, here our SQL statement can look like SELECT EMP_NAME FROM EMPLOYEE WHERE SALARY &gt; 100,000. This SQL statement can be converted to lots of variations of relational algebra of which are all true, two such examples could be σsalary&gt;100000 (πemp_name (Employee)) and πemp_name (σsalary&gt;100000 (Employee)). Once this is done the relational algebra expressions are sent to the optimizer. The optimizer calculates the cost of the query. Both these statements are valid relational algebra for the given SQL statement, but based on the CPU usage, disk usage, and network usage on each step, the optimizer will assign cost values to them. This information is sent to the evaluation plan which is a sequence of primitive or basic operations used to evaluate a query. The query evaluation engine takes the query evaluation plan and executes the plan and returns the answer to the query.</p>
<h3 id="tree-based-optimization">Tree-based optimization</h3>
<p>Tree-based optimization is an optimization technique where a query tree is generated. A query tree is a tree data structure representing a relational algebra expression. The tables of the query become the leaf nodes and the relational algebra operations become the internal nodes. In this, we move from the bottom of the tree or the leaf nodes to the top to the root. We start at the deepest node which will be a table and move up creating temporary relations, we keep going up and creating these temporary relations based on the operators at the nodes. These relations are called temporary since they are stored in the memory and will be removed at the end. This way we will eventually evaluate the operation at the root of the tree which will be the result of this expression. We can implement an exhaustive search where we generate all possible query trees and then select the best one. This will give us the optimal solution but has a large time and space complexity. We can also apply rule-based heuristics which have a lower time and space complexity, but they do not necessarily give the best solution. Here a rule could be to perform select and project operations before join operations.</p>
<h3 id="cost-based-optimization">Cost-based optimization</h3>
<p>Cost-based optimization is when the optimizer allocates a cost in numerical form which is related to each step of the possible plan and then finds the values to get the cost estimate for the plan or a possible strategy. After calculating the costs of all possible plans, the optimizer tries to choose a plan which will have the lowest cost estimate. For this reason, the optimizer is referred to as a cost-based optimizer. The cost of an operation can depend on the cardinality of the number of rows that are returned by performing the operations specified by the query execution plan, this affects the cost the most. The cost is also dependent on selectivity, which refers to the number of rows that are selected. The selectivity of any row from the table or any table from the database depends upon this condition. The cost also depends on the amount of money spent on the system to optimize the system. The different kinds of costs can be – access cost to secondary storage which is the cost of searching, reading, or writing data blocks on the secondary storage; memory usage cost which is the number of memory buffers that are needed for the execution of the query; storage cost is the cost of storing any intermediate files that are generated by the execution strategy for the query; computational cost the cost of performing the memory operations that are available on the record within the data buffers, this can also be called the CPU cost; and the communication cost which is the cost that is associated with sending or communication the query and its results from one place to another.</p>
