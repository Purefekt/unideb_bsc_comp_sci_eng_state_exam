<h2 id="part-1">Part 1</h2>
<p>Adversarial search is a search where we examine a problem that arises when we try to plan, and other agents are planning against us. This type of search strategy is not associated with a single agent, instead, there is more than one agent which is searching for the solution in the same search space. This situation usually occurs in game playing. An environment with more than one agent is called a multi-agent environment, in this, each agent is an opponent of the other agent and playing against each other. Each agent has to consider the action of other agents and the effect of that action on their performance. Games are modeled as a search problem and heuristic evaluation function; these are the two main factors that help to model and solve games in artificial intelligence. The types of games in AI:</p>
<ol>
<li>Perfect information – In this type of game, the agents have all the information or in other words can see the entire game board. They can see their opponent agent’s moves and current positions. Examples are chess and checkers.</li>
<li>Imperfect information – In this type of game the agents do not have all the information about the game, they might have partial information, but never the entire information. Examples are tic tac toe and battleship.</li>
<li>Deterministic Games – These types of games follow a strict pattern and set of rules for the games. There is no randomness associated with them. Examples are chess and tic tac toe.</li>
<li>Non-deterministic games – These types of games have various unpredictable events and have a factor of chance or luck. This luck factor is introduced by dice or cards. Examples are monopoly and poker.</li>
</ol>
<p>Zero-Sum games are adversarial search that involves pure competition. In these games, each agent’s gain or loss is perfectly balanced by the losses and gains of the competing agent. One player of the game tries to maximize one single value, while the other player tries to minimize it. A problem can be formalized with the following elements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Initial state – This specifies how the game is set up at the start.</li>
<li>Players – This specifies which player has moved in the state space</li>
<li>Actions – This returns the set of legal moves in the state space</li>
<li>Results – This is the transition model, which specifies the result of moves in the state space.</li>
<li>Terminal-test – This is set to true if the game is over, else this is false in all other cases. The state where the game ends is called the terminal state.</li>
<li>Utility function – This gives a numeric value for the terminal states. This can be won, lose, drawn, or any numerical value.</li>
</ol>
<p>The Minimax algorithm is a very famous example of an adversarial search algorithm used to solve two player games in which we are competing against one opponent agent. Usually, both agents taking part in such games have complete information, thus they are perfect information games. Minimax algorithm is a backtracking algorithm, which means we begin at the root node and traverse deep to the terminal nodes, here we calculate the values and propagate back to the root node and then choose the value or path to take. In such games, we deal with the concept of the best move or optimal move. Here both competing agents will make moves that are optimal towards making them the winner, this results in the optimal moves for each side being the worst-case scenario for the opponent agent. The reason this algorithm is called the Minimax algorithm is since we are dealing with two agents, the first one is MAX and the second one is MIN. In a Minimax algorithm, we form a binary game tree, each node will have 2 child nodes and this tree will increase based on the complexity, usually, the root node is where the MAX agent will have its chance, on the next level will be MIN agent and this way we keep on alternating one by one. The objective of MAX is to maximize its utility, and MIN will try to minimize its utility. MAX will try to make the best move from the point of view of the MAX agent, while MIN will try to make the worst movie from the point of view of the MAX agent, which in turn will be the best move from its point of view. We start with MAX at the root node, we can take one of two paths, once the path is chosen, now is the turn for MIN, it will have two paths as well. The leaf nodes or the terminal nodes have utility values, the negative values indicate that the MIN agent has won, and the positive values indicate that the MAX agent has won. Using backtracking and keeping in mind the chance of either MIN or MAX agent, we can determine the utility value for each node. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(bd) where b is the branching factor, or the number of possible choices and d is the depth. This is fine for games with a smaller number of choices, but the time complexity goes exponentially up for games like chess where there are lots of choices, this level of the game tree is not feasible.</p>
<p>To improve on the Minimax algorithm, we can use Alpha-beta pruning. Alpha-beta pruning can reduce the time complexity of the Minimax algorithm by cutting off or pruning some nodes, thus we do not traverse every single branch to find the optimal route for the MAX agent. This is done by pruning off the parts when we already found a better path. To find a path to prune, if a certain path’s parent node or any other node further up is a better choice, then we do not need to traverse that path at all. To calculate this we use two values, alpha, and beta. Alpha is the best choice or highest value we have found so far at any point along the path for MATH, alpha acts as a lower bound for all MAX nodes, thus only MAX nodes update the value of alpha. Initially, we take the value of alpha to be negative infinity. Beta is the best choice or lowest value we have found so far at any point along the path for MIN, it acts as an upper bound for all MIN values, thus only MIN nodes update the value of beta. Initially, we take the value of beta to be positive infinity. Since MINIMAX follows a depth-first search, we will start at the deepest left side node of the tree with values for alpha being negative infinity and beta being positive infinity. Using the same strategy as MINIMAX, we will find the values of alpha and beta, and using the construct that at a MAX node, the value must be equal to or greater than alpha, and at a MIN node, the value must be less than or equal to the beta, we will find the node values. But this way when we start to traverse a new node, we will first see if it follows the alpha-beta construct, if it does not then we can prune that branch since there is no point in visiting that branch. Alpha-beta pruning gives us the same steps as MINIMAX's final answer but uses less time to do so.</p>
<h2 id="part-2">Part 2</h2>
<p>A MOS transistor is also called a MOSFET transistor is the metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor. This transistor has four terminals, gate, substrate, drain, and source. The device is formed using the MOS structure in which we have three layers stacked on top of each other, the top layer is the metal layer, the second layer is the silicon oxide layer, and the last layer is the substrate layer. The top metal layer is connected to the gate terminal and has a gate voltage. The substrate layer is connected to the substrate terminal and has a substrate voltage. Concerning channel, we have two types of MOS transistors:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enhancement type – this has no conducting channel region between the source and drain when the gate voltage is zero.</li>
<li>Depletion type – this has a conducting channel region between the source and drain when a gate bias voltage is 0.
   MOSFETS vary the voltage on the gate by changing the resistance on the source and drain terminals. An example is an NMOS transistor in which we have a P-type substrate on which we create two heavily doped n-type regions, one of them is the source and the other is the drain. The oxide layer is deposited on top of the source and drain and then comes the metal layer on top of that. When a positive voltage is applied to the gate, this causes the depletion region to connect both the source and drain causing a field effect. At this point the electricity is not flowing, before the gate voltage has reached the threshold voltage, this is called saturation. When the gate voltage surpasses the threshold voltage the current flows between the source and drain.</li>
</ol>
<p>A large-signal model is an analysis method for transistors where we have nonlinear elements. Under large-signal conditions, AC signals have a high enough magnitude that nonlinear effects must be considered. In a large signal model, the large signal affects the operating point. The non-linear elements can be limited by power supply values to avoid variation in operating points. A small-signal model ignores these variations.</p>
<p>MOS transistors can be used as a switch to turn on and off. Billions of these switches are used in modern microprocessors. MOS transistors are good for switching since they are good for high power applications since they can switch faster, this lets them use smaller inductors and supplies, this, in turn, increases the efficiency of MOS transistors as a switch. When the gate voltage of the MOS transistor is less than the threshold voltage, the circuit is considered open and has no current flow, this is the OFF state. When the gate voltage of the MOS transistor is more than the threshold voltage, the circuit is closed, the current value is more than 0, this is the ON state.</p>
<p>CMOS inverter or simply CMOS is a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor that acts as a NOT gate or an inverter. A high voltage or a logic 1 will result in a logic 0 output and a low voltage or a logic 0 will result in a logic 1 output. A CMOS inverter is created with one PMOS or P-type channel MOS and one NMOS or N-type channel MOS. A PMOS has a P-type source and drain on an N-type substrate, and we have the output connected near the ground. PMOS gives a low output for high input and high output for low input. An NMOS has an N-type source and drains on a P-type substrate, and we have the output connected near the gate voltage. NMOS also gives a low output for high input and high output for low input, thus both PMOS and NMOS act as inverters. To create a CMOS inverter, we connect the PMOS and NMOS outputs with PMOS connected to the gate voltage and the NMOS connected to the ground. When the input is a logic 0, the NMOS circuit is open and the PMOS circuit is shorted, which means the PMOS is active, and we get a logic 1. When the input logic is 1, the PMOS circuit is open and the NMOS circuit is shorted, here the output connects to the ground and thus we get a logic 0. We use a CMOS inverter since it consumes less power when switching at high frequencies.</p>
<p>We can create a CMOS NAND gate using two PMOS and two NMOS. We connect the two PMOS in parallel and the two NMOS in series. The output is joined for all, the PMOS circuit connects to the gate voltage and the NMOS circuit connects to the ground. We have two inputs A and B. A is given to one PMOS and one NMOS and B is also given to one PMOS and one NMOS. In this circuit, when we apply logic 1 on both A and B, we get a logic 0 as output, and we get logic 1 in any other case. We can also create an AND gate by connecting the output of the CMOS NAND gate to a CMOS inverter.</p>
<p>We can create a CMOS NOR gate using two PMOS and two NMOS. We connect the two PMOS in series and the two NMOS in parallel. The output is joined for all, the PMOS circuit connects to the gate voltage and the NMOS circuit connects to the ground. We have two inputs A and B. A is given to one PMOS and one NMOS and B is also given to one PMOS and one NMOS. In this circuit, when we apply a logic 0 on both A and B, then we get a logic 1 as output, and we get a logic 0 in any other case. We can also create an OR gate by connecting the output of the CMOS NOR gate to a CMOS inverter.</p>
<p>The operational amplifier is a type of amplifier, amplifiers are devices that take in a signal and produce the same signal with a larger amplitude. Op-amps have a positive input called the non-inverting input and a negative input called the inverting input, the difference between these two inputs is the final input, thus this is called differential input. The output is the product of the differential inputs and the high gain of this device. Op-amps have a very high gain like 105 which makes the circuit design difficult because of high gain sensitivity. Negative feedback is when we connect the output back to the inverting input, this makes it possible to set again and cut off frequency to the desired value, which improves the stability and reduced variation. Op-amps are used for AC and DC signal amplification, voltage regulators, and as filters.</p>
